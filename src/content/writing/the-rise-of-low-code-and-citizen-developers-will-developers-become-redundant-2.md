Low code and no code platforms can make app creation feel like designing a slide deck rather than coding a software project, giving rise to a new crop of creators - citizen developers. For many, this change brings excitement. For others, it may raise some existential questions. Are seasoned developers about to be replaced? No. Is there room for professional developers in a world where anyone can code? Yes!

### What are low code platforms?
Low code and no code platforms aren't about coding in the traditional sense. Instead, you get a visual interface with drag-and-drop components and pre-built templates. Users can connect databases, create forms, and automate workflows with just a few clicks. This is pretty powerful as a team can go from idea to a functional prototype in a few hours rather than weeks. For small applications or dashboards, these tools are a game changers.

### The role of citizen developers
The term "citizen developer" is a way to describe people who, without formal training in coding, use these platforms to create business solutions. This approach tries to address a problem in many organizations - the demand for software outpaces what development teams can deliver. Citizen developers help keep organizations adaptable, especially for quick solutions that don't need complex architecture or back-end code.

### Why low code platforms won't replace traditional developers
As someone who has developed pro code on low code platforms for a variety of use cases and organizations, there are limitations that professional developers need to address.

- Integrations and interoperabilityLow code platforms might offer basic integrations out-of-the-box, but these are typically limited in depth and flexibility. For enterprise level applications that need to work with legacy systems, external or custom databases, seasoned developers are essential to ensure a smooth and reliable connection.
- Complexity and scalabilityAs projects grow in complexity it becomes a challenge for low code solutions to keep up. This is where experienced developers really shine, and it's unlikely that low code will fully replicate that expertise anytime soon.
- Security and complianceFor industries where security and compliance are non-negotiable, citizen developers may find themselves in uncharted territory. Following security protocols and remaining compliant is a critical task that falls outside the scope of citizen development.
- CustomizationOrganizations quickly realize that out-of-the-box templates, workflows, and interfaces do not meet all of their business needs. To adapt to a company's unique business processes, low code platforms typically offer some customization options. Professional developers are still required to write custom code for organizations to get the most out of the system.

### How developers fit into a low code world
So where do developers fit into the picture? Low code tools may take on some of the lighter development work, but developers are critical in taking these tools to the next level. Here is how we can stay relevant.

- Governance and oversightTo ensure quality, security, and consistency across the board, developers play a key role in establishing guidelines and reviewing developed applications.
- Innovation and strategyLow code frees up developers from handling every small detail about every small project. This means we can focus more on strategic, high-impact initiatives like large scale data processing, integrations, and complex workflows - areas where low code can't make an impact.
- Core infrastructureSince low code platforms don't make themselves, the foundational elements requires developers who understand the intricacies of data management, security, and scalability. These platform still need robust databases, reliable servers, and secure cloud infrastructure.
- Hybrid developmentCreating a blend of low code and traditional code is valuable for teams looking to get the most out of their platform. Embedding pro code into a low code application can facilitate highly complex business processes, data processing, user interface components, integrations, and automation.

### Conclusion
If you are developer, don't worry. You're not going anywhere. The rise of low code platforms and citizen developers is a shift, not a replacement. It is a shift that is exciting and empowering for all of us creating tomorrow's technology.
