                                rating your tools, and seeing what other people are using.
                                The data is the foundation everything else sits on. Before anyone can share software
                                they use or rate their tools, the software needs to be in our database. Right now that
                                means researching and organizing every modern software tool, normalizing naming across
                                vendors, and figuring out the right level of granularity (do Slack and Discord belong in
                                the same category, or not?).

                                which feels good, but I know we have a long way to go.

                                I&apos;m a technical manager and systems architect in government. My day job is
                                designing large scale systems on ServiceNow and AWS. The kind of systems that regularly
                                process 15+ million records and quietly keep federal agencies running. I lead a team of
                                twenty, but I still design and write code every day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I built internal tools at NIH during the early days of COVID, led engineering on a
                                security tool that cut ATO timelines from three months to two weeks, and was the lead
                                architect on a reusable component library used across dozens of project teams at CACI.
                                The balance has shifted toward system design, technical governance, and making sure my
                                people have what they need, but I never stopped building.
                            </p>

                                Outside of work, I&apos;m making SoftwareDB because I&apos;m genuinely obsessed with
                                software tools. Text editors, terminal emulators, browsers, IDEs, I care about this
                                stuff and there&apos;s no good place to see what people are running
                                and what they&apos;re switching to. The SoftwareDB waitlist is open and I&apos;m deep in
                                the MVP.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I&apos;m also working on Explodex, AI software that detects and identifies explosives
                                in photos and video. We&apos;ve built a full data pipeline with provenance tracking that
                                feeds into our training data, and the mission is simple: significantly reduce cognitive
                                load
                                for the people who need to defuse bombs when it matters most.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I&apos;m based in Maryland. When I&apos;m not at a screen I&apos;m racing cyclocross,
                                running 5Ks and 10Ks, or lifting. I recently went keto. I have a Saint Bernard who is
                                not on keto.
                                I&apos;m unreasonably obsessed with cables — ethernet, VGA, SATA, every type of USB —
                                because you never
                                know when you&apos;ll need one. And I will die on the hill that ThinkPads are the best
                                laptops ever made, even though I use a MacBook that I&apos;m terrified of scratching.
